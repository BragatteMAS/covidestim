- subtitle: Data
  desc: Covidestim expects three data sources to be present - case data, death data, and hospitalization data. These functions allow adding these data sources to the model configuration.
- contents:
  - starts_with("input")

- subtitle: Priors
  desc: These functions allow customization of model priors. By default, Covidestim comes with a complete set of priors. However, these functions make it possible to override the default parameterizations of the prior distributions, within certain constraints.

- title: Example data
  desc: Covidestim includes a utility to generate fake epidemic data, consisting of underlying truthy data, and reporting data that represents a limited and inaccurate picture of this underlying truthy data. These data can be used to assess model fit under a variety of hypothetical scenarios. We also provide an example NYC dataset to run the model with.
